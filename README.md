Welcome to My Custom Web Framework! 
Hi there!

This is my personal pet project—an evolving custom web application framework that I'm actively developing. I have big plans for it, and I know there's still a lot to improve—from variable naming to implementing key functionality.

But honestly, I'm excited about the journey! It might sound a bit crazy, but I have tons of ideas, and I want to share how this small project grows alongside my skills.

Stay tuned for updates, and feel free to explore, contribute, or just follow along! 😊
